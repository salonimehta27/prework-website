        <p id='aboutme'>
            This is Saloni, and my journey of being a software engineer starts with Flatiron school on April 26th 2021, this decision of mine
            is probably the best decision i have ever made for myself. 
            <br>
            <br>
            i was born and raised in India, my life in India was way different than my life in US. My passion for learning advanced technology 
            grew when i was in 7th grade i remember computers first started to get really popular in households in India so my Dad bought us a PC
            i was so super thrilled by it, back then i learned how to use internet and basic computers, my dad also sent me and my younger sibling
            to go get computer classes, which i thought was super cool and i believe that's where my passion grew for Computer and learning 
            how it works still amazes me. i went to pursue Computers Degree further in college in India. 
            <br>
            <br>
            after i moved here things changed for me, more responsibilities and learning to adapt to new environment was fun and challenging,
            fast-forward long story short, here i am today getting back to where i belong, i am back to continuing my career, my passion in Computers
            and i am very happy to be back.
